## Information
This is a simple tool to try to allow for quick, simple, and effective yara rule creation to isolate malware families. This is an experiment and thus far I've had pretty good success with it. It is a work in progress and I welcome forks and feedback!

To utilize this you must find a few files from a malware family you wish to profile, (the more the better, three to four samples seems to be effective). Place the samples in their own directory, and run the tool. Thats it! Yara Magic! Please note however that this tool will only be as precise as you are in choosing what you are looking for...

The theory behind the tool is as follows:


   As opposed to intensive analytical examination of a cadre of malware to determine similarities, by extracting all present strings and ensuring only to signature for those present in all desired samples and requiring ENOUGH of them to be present to equal a match, similar results can be achieved.

   In many ways this is less flexible than the existing methodology, but in some ways more so, as it relies less on anomalous indicators which can easily be changed. That said it needs a lot of work and tuning, because the risk is run of capturing strings only present in your sample set, but not the family at large. Lowering the critical hit from 100% of strings may approach a usable compromise there.

   In the future I will create a list of thousands of strings we never want to signature for and remove them from potentials for the rules.

   Current hard set variables are 30 random strings selected from those present in all binary samples of six or more printable chars.

## Example

Usage is as follows with an example of a basic search +  hitting all of
the switches below:
<pre>

usage: yaraGenerator.py [-h] -r RULENAME [-a AUTHOR] [-d DESCRIPTION]
                        InputDirectory

YaraGenerator

positional arguments:
  InputDirectory        Path To Files To Create Yara Rule From

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RULENAME         Enter A Rule/Alert Name (No Spaces + Must Start with Letter)
  -a AUTHOR           Enter Author Name
  -d DESCRIPTION      Provide a useful description of the Yara Rule
</pre>

Example Usage To Build Two Rules from 3-4 Samples:
